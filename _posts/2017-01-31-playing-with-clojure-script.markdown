Recently, I just got really excited about [Clojure][clojure-website].

After studing the langage for some time I decided to build something simple and fun.

Since I was planning to also see how the langague works in the [ClojureScript][cljs-website] version and how stable and fun would be to use it with [figwheel][figwheel-website], I decided to make the classic snake game using [ClojureScript][clsj-website] with the figwheel flow.

The experience was amazing. The instant feedback you get with [figwheel][figwheel-website] and the super expressive and clean code you write with [Clojure][clojure-website] made me rethink completelly how I'm developing user interfaces.

You can check it out by [playing the game][clojure-snake-game]

You can also check the [code][clojure-snake-code]

If you have any feedback, please let me know!
